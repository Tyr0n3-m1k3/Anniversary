            <h2>My Dearest Love...</h2>
            <p>My Love,

These last five years… where do I even begin? They’ve been a whirlwind—intense, beautiful, chaotic, and, at times, painfully confusing. We’ve loved each other so deeply, yet we’ve also clashed, misunderstood, and taken breaks that felt like forever. But each time, no matter how far apart we drifted, we always found our way back. That means something. That is love.

We weren’t always on the same page. Sometimes we were in completely different books. But every time I looked up, your name was still written in the margins of my story. That’s how I knew it wasn’t over. That it couldn’t be over.

I won’t pretend we’re perfect. Love isn’t about perfection. It’s about choosing each other, every day, even when it’s hard. Especially when it’s hard.

And now, moving forward… it’s only commitment. No more running, no more fear. Just you and me. Together. Always.

Through every fight, every silence, every tear—we’ve grown. We’ve built something real. And I wouldn’t trade this love for anything.

Forever yours, with all my heart (and a thousand soft pink hearts floating around us),

—Your Man
